# Cover Letters

EngineerCV includes a specialized cover letter theme that allows you to create professional cover letters using the same YAML-based approach as resumes. Cover letters can be generated independently or combined with resume variants.

## Basic Cover Letter Structure

A cover letter requires specific data fields and uses the cover letter theme:

```yaml
imports:
  - ./src/themes/coverletter.tsx

output: ./out/cover-letter.pdf

basics:
  name: John Doe
  subtitle: Senior Software Engineer
  subject: Application for Software Engineer Position

letterDate: "{{ date 'dddd, MMMM Do YYYY' }}"

fromAddress:
  - John Doe
  - 123 Developer Street
  - Tech City, TC 12345
  - john.doe@email.com

toAddress:
  - Hiring Manager
  - Tech Company
  - 456 Business Ave
  - Corporate City, CC 67890

body: |
